- the difference between commands such as `createdb`, `dropdb` and commands such a `CREATE DATABASE` `DROP DATABASE` are the the former are commands that can be executed from the terminal, and the latter commands are SQL statements that are can be run from a SQL client application, such as the `psql` console. however, the former commands are essentially client applications that are wrappers around the latter statements, so the same thing happens underneath the hood despite which set of commands we use.
